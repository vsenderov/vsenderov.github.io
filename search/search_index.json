Ultimately, semantic databases and probabilistic programming languages are tools to explicitly represent knowledge about the state and dynamics of real-world systems.  Using these tools is scientific as it facilitates understanding and explainability.  My current research hypothesis (2025-03-05) is that we still need such formal tools as a source of determinism in our intelligent systems and that they can be combined with state-of-the-art neural systems that act as a front-end to them.  This is in contrast to the recently established view that LLMs are \"foundational models.\"  In my opinion, LLMs, CNNs, etc. should be used as wrappers around a more robust system for knowledge-representation such as a semantic database or a probabilistic program, which serves as a back-end.  In 2024 I wrote a research proposal outlining some of these views, which I am sharing below:</p> <p>2024_Research_vision_DDLS.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Career/Skills/","title":"Skills","text":"<p>Disclaimer</p> <p>Disclaimer the following is a self-assessment of my skills.</p> <p>The note is structured as follows: it begins with an itemized list, and each major bullet item is linked to a short text with some concrete examples of the skill.   </p>"},{"location":"Career/Skills/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<ul> <li>Management and leadership of software and research projects:<ul> <li>establishing project vision</li> <li>making key contributions and designing software architecture</li> <li>coordinating development work via meetings and GitHub</li> <li>evangelizing at symposia and conferences</li> <li>preparing written materials (papers, technical reports, budgets, grant reports, grant proposals)</li> <li>organizing conferences</li> <li>communicating with collaborators</li> </ul> </li> <li>Science communication<ul> <li>distilling hard concepts into simple language</li> <li>public speaking</li> </ul> </li> <li>Computer science and statistics<ul> <li>compiler design and implementation, </li> <li>implementation of statistical inference procedures,</li> <li>graph databases and semantic analysis of text,</li> <li>data analysis and data science, and </li> <li>efficient algorithms.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Computational biology and bioinformatics, in particular:<ul> <li>phylogenetics and </li> <li>population biology.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Programming:<ul> <li>Probabilistic programming (TreePPL\u2014own language, WebPPL, STAN),</li> <li>Semantic web (OWL, RDF, SQL),</li> <li>Functional programming for compilers (Miking, OCaml),</li> <li>Programming for data analysis (R, Python, Javascript, node.js),</li> <li>Performance-oriented programming (CUDA, C, C++),</li> <li>Applications programming (Java)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Information Technology<ul> <li>Linux and Unix systems administration</li> <li>Deploying compute loads on HPC clusters</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I am also a whole human being with my interests and hobbies and my assessment is that through formal and informal education, interactions with other people, reading books, thinking, doing my hobbies I have acquired the knowledge and appreciation for:</p> <ul> <li>Empathy and being a good husband, friend, and colleague</li> <li>Futurism, science fiction, and creative writing</li> <li>Linguistics</li> <li>Sports</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Career/Skills/#management-and-leadership-of-software-and-research-projects","title":"Management and leadership of software and research projects","text":"<p>I have lead two science\u2013software projects in my career until 2025-03-05:  OpenBiodiv and TreePPL.</p>"},{"location":"Career/Skills/#openbiodiv","title":"OpenBiodiv","text":"<p>The OpenBiodiv project aka \"The Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System\" is a project that I lead as a Marie Curie PhD student (2016 - 2019) at Pensoft Publishers, co-hosted at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.  Pensoft is a publisher of academic research papers, primarily in the area of biodiversity, and the idea of the project is to develop a theoretical framework (ontology, text miners), and a software system implementing this theoretical framework to extract knowledge from published articles and store this knowledge in an intelligent database for later retrieval.  At the helm of this project I was responsible for managing all of these aspects and made key contributions both to theory and to implementation.  I lead the creation the OpenBiodiv-O ontology and the first version of the text extractors and other software components behind the knowledge-base.  My primary focuses during this time were to establish a succinct vision for the project and to coordinate the efforts of scientific collaborators and programmers towards this vision.   This included co-authoring papers, writing various reports for the EU, managing budgets, discussing implementation plans and software architecture with programmers, going to and organizing conferences.</p> <p>OpenBiodiv continues to be an interest of mine, as I believe its architecture of grounding knowledge about biodiversity in scientific truth may work well with newer advances in neural language processing.

The field of phylogenetics concerns itself with inferring the long-term (millions of years) evolutionary relationships between organismal populations.  It can be contrasted with its sister field of population genetics, which looks at the changes of allele frequencies in populations over more recent time scales (thousands of years).  There is little to none genetic data over long timescales, and the only direct evidence that we can find comes from paleontological finds, which give us some understanding of the morphology (shape) of the organisms, but not their genetic makeup.  However, there is an abundance of data for present populations based on genomic sequences of extant taxa (species).  So the statistical models involved often have a large input dataset but also a large hidden space to explore.  The historical development of the field progressed from maximum-parsimony models, to maximum-likelihood models, to Bayesian models, the third one being preferred more and more in recent times, as it accommodates uncertainty and facilitates explainability.  </p> <p>The premise of TreePPL is to speed-up the development of Bayesian models by computational biologists.  Its builds upon the idea of probabilistic programming, which separates model definition from implementation of the inference.  Our vision is to enable practitioners to focus on the domain modeling, while piggy-backing on state-of-the-art inference methods (variations of Markov-chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo).  We want to provide (a) a very ergonomic interface for model-specification and (b) a set of very efficient pre-built inference runtimes that can be applied to the user-supplied model.</p> <p>As a postdoc at Ronquist Lab I was responsible for designing the TreePPL language, leading the engineering effort to produce the minimal viable version, and doing some pilot studies.  As with OpenBiodiv my responsibilities were heterogeneous, and while I contributed significantly to the design specification and later to the compiler implementation, key parts of my job included facilitating cooperation between various people working on the software components, working with practitioners on real-world use cases, and teaching about the language and popularizing probabilistic programming at conferences, e.g. see my keynote in Galway, or the 2024 Miking workshop. </p> <p>What I learned from this experience is that designing a novel programming language with the primary purpose of not investigating new language paradigms but rather creating added value for users by leveraging novel compiler techniques is an extremely challenging and complex task and goes beyond academic research.  I think it built upon my previous work with OpenBiodiv and contributed to improving my skillset for leading both software and research projects.  As references for my activities here, you may contact Fredrik Ronquist or David Broman, who were the project's PI's, or my peers Jan Kudlicka, who was the project co-lead, or Daniel Lund\u00e9n, who made the key technical contributions to the compiler back-end.</p>"}]}
