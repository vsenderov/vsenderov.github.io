Pensoft is a publisher of academic research papers, primarily in the area of biodiversity, and the idea of the project is to develop a theoretical framework (ontology, text miners), and a software system implementing this theoretical framework to extract knowledge from the published articles and store this knowledge in an intelligent database for later retrieval.  At the helm of this project I was responsible for managing all of these aspects and made key contributions both to theory and to implementation.  I lead the creation the OpenBiodiv-O ontology and the first version of the text extractors and other software components behind the knowledge-base.  My primary focuses during this time were to establish a succinct vision for the project by discussing with industry and researchers and then to coordinate the efforts of scientific collaborators and programmers towards this vision.   This included co-authoring papers, writing various reports for the EU, managing budgets, discussing implementation plans and software architecture with programmers, going to and organizing conferences.</p> <p>OpenBiodiv continues to be an interest of mine, as I believe its architecture of grounding knowledge about biodiversity in scientific truth may work well with newer advances in neural language processing.  If the reader would like to verify my claims here, I invite you to contact my academic advisor, the  Lyubomir Penev, or my academic co-advisor Kiril Simov, or my other co-advisor Pavel Stoev.</p>"},{"location":"skills/#treeppl","title":"TreePPL","text":"<p>TreePPL Probabilistic Programming Language for Phylogenetics</p>"}]}
