Ultimately, semantic databases and probabilistic programming languages are tools to explicitly represent knowledge about the state and dynamics of real-world systems.  Using these tools is scientific as it facilitates understanding and explainability.  My current research thesis (2025-03-05) is that we still need such formal tools as a source of determinism in our intelligent systems and that they can be combined with state-of-the-art neural systems that act as a front-end to them.  This is in contrast to the recently established view that LLMs are \"foundational models.\"  In my opinion, LLMs, CNNs, etc. should be used as wrappers around a more robust system for knowledge-representation such as a semantic database or a probabilistic program, which serves as a back-end.  In 2024 I wrote a research proposal outlining some of these views, which I am sharing below:</p> <p>2024_Research_vision_DDLS.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Career/Skills/","title":"Skills","text":"<p>Disclaimer</p> <p>Disclaimer the following is a self-assessment of my skills as they may pertain to a future career.

Pensoft is a publisher of academic research papers, primarily in the area of biodiversity, and the idea of the project is to develop a theoretical framework (ontology, text miners), and a software system implementing this theoretical framework to extract knowledge from published articles and store this knowledge in an intelligent database for later retrieval.  At the helm of this project I was responsible for managing all of these aspects and made key contributions both to theory and to implementation.  I lead the creation the OpenBiodiv-O ontology and the first version of the text extractors and other software components behind the knowledge-base.  My primary focuses during this time were to establish a succinct vision for the project via brain-storming and discussions with industry and researchers and then to coordinate the efforts of scientific collaborators and programmers towards this vision.   This included co-authoring papers, writing various reports for the EU, managing budgets, discussing implementation plans and software architecture with programmers, going to and organizing conferences.</p> <p>OpenBiodiv continues to be an interest of mine, as I believe its architecture of grounding knowledge about biodiversity in scientific truth may work well with newer advances in neural language processing.
